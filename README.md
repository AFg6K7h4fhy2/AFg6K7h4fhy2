## Aesthetics

![cover](https://github.com/AFg6K7h4fhy2/AFg6K7h4fhy2/raw/main/assets/profile_images/unidentified.jpg)

I am very much motivationally uplifted by looking at beautiful works of art; as such, I include them in my profile, which I've bookmarked on FireFox and which is a place I head to often. That this picture is the first object seen on my profile is by design. I rotate artworks not more than twice monthly.

## Context

I consider myself an average data scientist*.

> _Data Scientist: Person who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better software engineering than any statistician._
>
> —Josh Wills

My perspective on my skills is more aligned with this variant of the above:

> _Data Scientist: Person who is worse at statistics than any statistician and worse at software engineering than any software engineer._

At present, I work for the [Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics](https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analytics/index.html) (CFA).

## Communication

With respect to communication, I operate by [^crocker]

<details markdown=1>
<summary>
Crocker's Rules
</summary>

> Declaring yourself to be operating by "Crocker's Rules" means that other people are allowed to optimize their messages for information, not for being nice to you.  Crocker's Rules means that you have accepted full responsibility for the operation of your own mind - if you're offended, it's your fault.  Anyone is allowed to call you a moron and claim to be doing you a favor.  (Which, in point of fact, they would be.  One of the big problems with this culture is that everyone's afraid to tell you you're wrong, or they think they have to dance around it.)  Two people using Crocker's Rules should be able to communicate all relevant information in the minimum amount of time, without paraphrasing or social formatting.  Obviously, don't declare yourself to be operating by Crocker's Rules unless you have that kind of mental discipline.
>
> Note that Crocker's Rules does not mean you can insult people; it means that other people don't have to worry about whether they are insulting you.  Crocker's Rules are a discipline, not a privilege.  Furthermore, taking advantage of Crocker's Rules does not imply reciprocity.  How could it?  Crocker's Rules are something you do for yourself, to maximize information received - not something you grit your teeth over and do as a favor.

> "Crocker's Rules" are named after Lee Daniel Crocker.

Any feedback is appreciated. If you have something to critique me on or tell me, please [make an issue here](https://github.com/AFg6K7h4fhy2/AFg6K7h4fhy2/issues) or in the specific repository you have comments on. I can also be contacted at <my profile name> <at> <proton> <dot> <me>. As far as roasts go, [this AI bot](https://github-roast.pages.dev/) critiqued any earlier version of my profile...which I am taking as feedback:

A Roasting Of My Profile
</summary>

> Well, well, well, if it isn't the enigma of GitHub! "upx3—TM (CFA)"? Is that a name or a failed CAPTCHA test? With a bio as bland as plain toast and just a few followers, it seems like you're trying to forecast your own social life—spoiler alert: it's not looking good.

> You’re a Data Scientist at the CDC, yet the only thing your repositories seem to be good at is collecting dust. I see you’ve dabbled in Python, JAX, and NumPyro; too bad your coding skills are hiding away like your personality. And what’s with the fascination with paleontology and global catastrophic risk? Are you trying to model not just diseases but your own social extinction?
>
> Your readme looks more like an art critique than a professional introduction. Maybe instead of allocating your time to creating personal templates that even you can’t be bothered to star, you could take a moment to autocorrect your ambition into something a little less… unfocused?
>
> But hey, kudos for the “good health” wishes at the end—because clearly, you have plenty of time to ponder life choices while your code sits idle. Here’s hoping your next repo has as much personality as the artwork you’re so proud of.

> If some future organisms found the remains of humans only as fossils, it would not be astonished. It would place them with the monkeys; its peculiarity would only be in its bipedal gait, but bipedalism would have already been recognized as a common form of locomotion. The abnormally swollen, bubbled-up brain-capsule might draw attention; but it would hardly be evident from physiology alone that this was the species that transformed the planet in a way unlike any other in the billions of years of life's history.
