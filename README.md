Greetings, I am a Data Scientist at the [Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics](https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analytics/index.html) (CFA), which is part of the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/) (CDC).


Dear reader, I wish you good health and a nice year.

Getting Roasted by...[this thing](https://github-roast.pages.dev/)...taking this as feedback:

> Well, well, well, if it isn't the enigma of GitHub! "upx3—TM (CFA)"? Is that a name or a failed CAPTCHA test? With a bio as bland as plain toast and just a few followers, it seems like you're trying to forecast your own social life—spoiler alert: it's not looking good.
>
> You’re a Data Scientist at the CDC, yet the only thing your repositories seem to be good at is collecting dust. I see you’ve dabbled in Python, JAX, and NumPyro; too bad your coding skills are hiding away like your personality. And what’s with the fascination with paleontology and global catastrophic risk? Are you trying to model not just diseases but your own social extinction?
>
> Your readme looks more like an art critique than a professional introduction. Maybe instead of allocating your time to creating personal templates that even you can’t be bothered to star, you could take a moment to autocorrect your ambition into something a little less… unfocused?
>
> But hey, kudos for the “good health” wishes at the end—because clearly, you have plenty of time to ponder life choices while your code sits idle. Here’s hoping your next repo has as much personality as the artwork you’re so proud of.
