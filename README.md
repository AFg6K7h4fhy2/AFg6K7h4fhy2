Greetings, I am a Data Scientist at the [Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics](https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analytics/index.html) (CFA), which is part of the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/) (CDC).

* For some time now, as part of my job, I've been absorbing procedural bayesian inference knowledge and have also been familiarizing myself with practices in infectious disease modelling.
* Each week, I typically use [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/quickstart.html) and [Numpyro](https://num.pyro.ai/en/stable/getting_started.html); the majority of my code is written in Python.
* Beyond infectious disease modelling, I am especially fascinated by and engaged with certain topics in paleontology, decision-making, global catastrophic risk, AI safety, and genetic engineering.
* To contact me, please email me at l + the_number_eight + utfymhz [at] mozmail [dot] com
* If there is any feedback (all is welcome) you want to send my way, please create an issue or email me.

Dear reader, I wish you good health and a nice year.
