# The CONTRIBUTION File

_This document is an attempt by the author to create a `CONTRIBUTION` file that the author can abide by and that will engender, from others contributing to the author's repositories, pleasant and useful discussions._

Since the author has never had to interact with many unknown developers rapidly or on a continual basis, the following `CONTRIBUTION` file suggestions are biased towards smaller, less frequented repositories, though these suggestions (beyond those in the community guidelines) may still be useful to have on larger projects, where "larger" might mean repositories with over 25 stars or 5 pull requests made by people with whom the author is not familiar.

At a minimum, the author wishes to remind developers of GitHub's community guidelines. Thus, including the following section in the author's `CONTRIBUTION` files seems apt:

> [GitHub Community Guidelines](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/content/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines.md):
>
> The primary purpose of the GitHub community is to collaborate on software projects. We are committed to maintaining a community where users are free to express themselves and challenge one another's ideas, both technical and otherwise. At the same time, it's important that users remain respectful and allow space for others to contribute openly. In order to foster both a safe and productive environment, we encourage our community members to look to these guidelines to inform how they interact on our platform. Below, you’ll find some suggestions for how to have successful interactions as a valued member of the GitHub community.
>
> * __Be welcoming and open-minded__ - New users join our community each day. Some are well-established developers, while others are just beginning. Be open to other ideas and experience levels. Make room for opinions other than your own and be welcoming to new collaborators and those just getting started.
> * __Be respectful__ - Working in a collaborative environment means disagreements may happen. But remember to criticize ideas, not people. Share thoughtful, constructive criticism and be courteous to those you interact with. If you’re unable to engage respectfully, consider taking a step back or using some of our moderation tools to deescalate a tense situation.
> * __Be empathetic__ - GitHub is a global community with people from a wide variety of backgrounds and perspectives, many of which may not be your own. Try to put yourself in others’ shoes and understand their feelings before you address them. Do your best to help make GitHub a community where others feel safe to make contributions, participate in discussions, and share different ideas.

GitHub's community guidelines are, in the author's mind, already quite good at enhancing the utility and atmosphere of the average developer interaction. With moderate strength, urging developers working on anything the author has produced to follow these community guidelines seems like a reasonable thing to ask for in a `CONTRIBUTION` file.

The suggestions to be welcoming and open-minded, to be respectful, and to be empathetic do not capture other wishes the author has for co-developers, though. These wishes include urgings to prioritize impact and the usage of evidence in justifying action. As such, the author intends, secondarily, to urge those contributing to his projects[^five] to abide by the following suggestions:

[^five]: The author could list many suggestions here and it is difficult to have non-overlapping suggestions. The author also wants to be respectful of those people contributing to his projects (not a trivial deed, and something to be grateful for, even if the tone of the comments or the remarks are harsh!), and having not many "asks" factors into this, at least in the author's perspective. As such, the number of external suggestions is capped by the author at five.

- **Use Evidence**: Please attempt to back suggestions, contributions, code changes, and feature requests with evidence, such as relevant documentation, benchmarks, research papers, or conversations, among other things.
- **Transparency**: Please attempt to maintain transparency in discussions by clearly state your motivations, assumptions, and any limitations in your contributions or suggestions. Be explicit about areas where you are uncertain or where your evidence is incomplete, specifying the degree of uncertainty where possible.
- **Adherence To Standards**: Please attempt to follow existing standards or best practices relevant to the project, tools, or procedures to ensure consistency and readability.
- **Prioritize Impact**: Please attempt to consider how your contributions affect the project's broader goals, integration with other tools or workflows, and long-term implications. Focus on improving the project's quality, usability, and performance. Reflect on its role within the context of civilization and strive to minimize harm or wasted effort.
- **Maintain Integrity**: Do not intentionally misrepresent data, results, or contributions. Please always strive for epistemic rigor, accuracy, and honesty.

As a final statement, the author wants to remark in his `CONTRIBUTION` files that these contribution guidelines are open to revision via reasonable suggestions.

Together, the aforementioned (as of 2025-02-08) yield a `CONTRIBUTION` file akin to the following:
