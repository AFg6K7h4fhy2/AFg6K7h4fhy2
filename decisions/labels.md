# Selection Of Labels And Labels Colors

The following document outlines some considerations for the labels and label colors the author uses on GitHub. The goal for these decisions is to be more deliberative than they otherwise would have been had it not been for this document.

Across the author's repositories the following labels are used:

* bug:
* data:
* dependencies:
* development:
* discussion:
* documentation:
* duplicate:
* enhancement:
* enterprise_practice:
* experimental:
* explanation:
* good first issue:
* governance:
* guides:
* help wanted:
* invalid:
* learning:
* meetings:
* presentations:
* question:
* reading:
* references:
* resources:
* standards:
* templates:
* top_level:
* tutorials:
* urgent:
* visuals:
* wontfix:
* writing
