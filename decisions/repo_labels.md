# Labels And Labels Colors

This document collects the author's considerations for the employment of issue labels in their GitHub repositories. Among these considerations are label color, purpose, and description. The author's goal here is to, through this document, make decisions that are more deliberate than would be the case had it not been for this document. Please provide feedback if you have any (create an issue [here](https://github.com/AFg6K7h4fhy2/AFg6K7h4fhy2/issues)).

Presently, the labels are all colored gray (`#cfd3d7`). Colored labels are more noticeable, but this can be harmful, possibly overwhelming those who are sensitive to bright colors or confusing those with color blindness. Colored labels could conceivably hastening collaborators' issue-framing, but the author perceive this effect to be small. Given the cognitive burden of deliberately choosing which colors to associate with the above labels, the author has opted to keep the labels colored gray. The following Wikipedia articles might prove useful for future deliberate label coloration efforts:
