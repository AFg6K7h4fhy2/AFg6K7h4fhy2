```

Description:

> * üöÄ A single tool to replace pip, pip-tools, pipx, poetry, pyenv, twine, virtualenv, and more.
> * ‚ö°Ô∏è 10-100x faster than pip.
> * üóÇÔ∏è Provides comprehensive project management, with a universal lockfile.
> * ‚ùáÔ∏è Runs scripts, with support for inline dependency metadata.
> * üêç Installs and manages Python versions.
> * üõ†Ô∏è Runs and installs tools published as Python packages.
> * üî© Includes a pip-compatible interface for a performance boost with a familiar CLI.
> * üè¢ Supports Cargo-style workspaces for scalable projects.
> * üíæ Disk-space efficient, with a global cache for dependency deduplication.
> * ‚è¨ Installable without Rust or Python via curl or pip.
> * üñ•Ô∏è Supports macOS, Linux, and Windows.

Given speed upgrade and centralization of capabilities, I've decided (2025-05-12) that I will use `uv` over `poetry` for Python package and project management.

Porting Over From UV To Poetry:

* Skip the next two steps if `poetry` is less than version 2.0.
* Check to see if the following is in `pyproject.toml`; if the lines are not present[^more], add them:

```yaml
[tool.poetry.requires-plugins]
poetry-plugin-export = ">=1.8"
```

[^more]: For more information on `poetry` plugins, see [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/plugins/#using-plugins); for more information on the `export` command, see [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#export).

* Run `poetry install`.
* Check the `pyproject.toml` file for different groups, such as `dev` and `test`; run the following command with the groups you want:

```
poetry export \
  --format=requirements.txt \
  --without-hashes \
  --with dev,test \
  --output=requirements.txt
```

* Create a `project` section in the `pyproject` file (see standard below)
  * If a section is not made, then the error when you run the next command might look like: "No `project` table found in ...".

<summary> Standard Pyproject Project Table </summary>


```yaml
[project]
name = ""
version = ""
authors = [
  {name = "", email = ""},
]
description = ""
readme = ""
license = ""
keywords = [""]

[project.urls]
Repository = ""
Issues = ""
"Author GitHub" = ""
```

</details>

* Ensure the `requirements.txt` file has the dependencies of interest before running:

```
uv add --r requirements.txt
```

Tasks related to the issue "Prepare Repository for production:

* Pin `uv` to appropriate Python version (`uv python pin 3.13`)
